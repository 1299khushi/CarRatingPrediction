Car24 (Car Rating Prediction)________________________________________
Introduction:
The task at hand is to develop a predictive model to estimate the engine rating based on inspection parameters provided
in a dataset. This involves loading and preparing the data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), building a 
predictive model, evaluating its performance, and conducting outlier analysis to identify cases where the rating may
be incorrect. The goal is to showcase proficiency in Python/R programming, data science techniques, and the ability
to deliver actionable insights within a commercial setting.

Final best accuracy achieved : 83.3%

a. Steps Taken:
EDA: Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables, and visualize the rating distribution
with in the dataset.

7    10152

8     2209


❖	Original data size: 22684
❖	Filtered data size (without mislabels): 11934
❖	Removed mislabeled cases: 10750

Data Preparation Statistical Measures for Evaluation: 
●	used Chi-Square Testing to check the dependency of categorical independent variable and target variable.

●	Prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values by replacing categorical variable with mode, and numerical with mean.
●	perform label encoding for categorical variables, and splitting into training and testing sets.

Model Building: firstly tried Random forest classifier model (but it results in bad accuracy of around 53%) , 
and below is their confusion matrix and classification report.












●	after model prediction , I checked the outliers:








●	perform PCA to reduce dimensionality, and as data is unbalanced , I applied Smote to balance it,
●	did hyperparameter tuning (grid search) and using ExtraTreesClassifier model for getting best accuracy of 83.3% .

 Encountered Issues:
Challenges include handling missing data, selecting appropriate features, and addressing potential outliers in the dataset.
e. Insights Obtained:
Important features influencing engine rating are identified through feature importance analysis.
Visualizations such as scatter plots, and box plots help understand relationships between variables and detect patterns in the data.
